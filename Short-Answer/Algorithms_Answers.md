#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This is O(n). Because in the "while" loop it cancels out two of the "n's"


b) This is O(nlogn) since it looks over each item (i) to see what additional work needs to be done. it's searching (sorting) then putting back together


c) This is also O(n) since it returns at the same rate of 2 + bunnyears -- predictable

## Exercise II

O(log(n))

Since the egg definitely breaks on Floor F:
    I would start at Floor C to see if it breaks:
        If it does break:
            I would go to Floor B- if it breaks then you know that Floor A is right.
        If it doesn't break on Floor C:
            I would go to Floor E- if it breaks then you know that Floor D is right
